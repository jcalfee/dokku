# 0.30.0 Migration Guide

## Changes

- The `app.json` file is now extracted from the source code instead of the built image. For deploys via `git:from-image`, the file is extracted from the built image.

## Removals

- Support for [SPDY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPDY) has been removed. No major browser supports it as of 2021. Custom `nginx.conf.sigil` templates referencing spdy-related variables will continue to build until the 1.0.0 release.
- Support for the `DOKKU_SCALE` file - deprecated in 0.25.0 - has been removed in favor of the `formations` key in the `app.json` file. Please see the [process management documentation](/docs/processes/process-management.md#manually-managing-process-scaling) for more information on how to use the `formation` key of the `app.json` file.
- The deprecated `--detach` global flag for `dokku run` was removed. Please see the [one-off tasks documentation](/docs/processes/one-off-tasks.md#running-a-detached-container) for more information on running detached containers.
- The following deprecated trigger have been removed in favor of the `post-release-builder` trigger. See the [plugin triggers documentation](https://dokku.com/docs/development/plugin-triggers/#post-release-builder) for more details.
    - `post-release-buildpack`
    - `post-release-dockerfile`
    - `post-release-pack`
- The ability to call `logs:failed` without specifying an app or `--all` flag has been removed. This was deprecated in 0.22.0. Please see the [logs:failed](/docs/deployment/logs.md#failed-deploy-logs).
